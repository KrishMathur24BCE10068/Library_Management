# Project Title
Library Book Management System

# Overview of the Project
This project is a desktop-based application developed using Java Swing.  
The main purpose of the system is to make library management easier by storing book and member information digitally instead of using manual registers.  
The system allows the librarian to add books, register members, and maintain records of issued and returned books.  
It helps in reducing manual errors and makes it easy to track which books are available and which are currently issued.
