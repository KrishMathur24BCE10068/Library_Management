roject Statement — Library Book Management System

🔹 Problem Statement
In many small libraries and institutes, book records are still maintained manually.  
Maintaining registers for books, members and issuing/returning becomes time-consuming and error-prone.  
Due to manual handling:
- Books get misplaced
- Availability is not tracked properly
- Issue/return history is not maintained
- Manual search takes too much time

Therefore, a system is required to **digitally manage the complete library operation** efficiently.



 🔹 Scope of the Project
The project focuses on creating an easy-to-use desktop-based library management system using Java Swing.  
The system allows library staff to:
- Manage books and their availability
- Register and update library members
- Issue and return books
- Generate transaction reports

The scope is limited to **offline use without internet** and **single-library management**.



 🔹 Target Users
The application is designed for:
- School / College Libraries
- Private Institute Libraries
- Reading Clubs
- Small public libraries

The primary users are:
- Librarian
- Library staff
- Admin / Faculty in institutions



 🔹 High-Level Features
- Add / update / delete books
- Search books by title
- Track total and available book copies
- Add / update / delete members
- Issue books to members
- Return previously issued books
- View complete transaction history
- Prevent deletion if a book is issued or a member has outstanding books



🔹 Expected Outcome
A fully working desktop application that:
- Reduces manual library work
- Increases accuracy of record keeping
- Improves tracking of book issues and returns
- Simplifies daily library tasks
